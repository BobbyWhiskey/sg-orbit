## Maintainers

### Monorepo

This project repository is managed as a monorepo that is composed of many NPM packages. 

For more information on monorepo:

- [Babel Github](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/doc/design/monorepo.md)
- [Shopify Github](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/blob/master/Decision%20records/00%20-%20Use%20a%20Lerna%20monorepo.md)
- [Google it!](https://www.google.com/search?q=monorepo)

**Lerna**

We use [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) for managing our monorepo. The packages of the monorepo can be found in the [packages](https://github.com/gsoft-inc/sg-brand/tree/master/packages) directory. 

Exceptionally the website is not managed by the monorepo tooling since it's not an NPM package. The website can be found in the [website](https://github.com/gsoft-inc/sg-brand/tree/master/website) directory.

Since Yarn workspace feature offer native mono-repo capabilities and a seemless integration with Lerna this is our goto package manager for this project.

When Lerna is configured to use Yarn, the installation of the NPM dependencies and the management of the packages inter-dependencies will be delegated to Yarn. It result in an increase of performance and a more reliable experience than using the same features from Lerna. The native integration between Lerna and Yarn make it worthwill to switch from NPM to Yarn for this project.

So why do we use Lerna if Yarn workspace take care of everything?

Lerna workflow greatly facilitate the release of the packages of a monorepo. 

For more information, view the following Lerna commands documentation:

- [version](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/tree/master/commands/version)
- [publish command](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/tree/master/commands/publish#readme)

This monorepo is configured to release the packages independently. The decision to release or not a package is automatically based on wether the code of the package has changed or not.

**Yarn workspace**

As mentionned, this monorepo is using Yarn workspace feature to handle the installation of the NPM dependencies and manage the packages inter-dependencies.

Remember that only the **packages** are handled by Yarn workspace since the **website isn't configured** to be handled by the monorepo tooling.

It's also important to note that Yarn workspace will **hoist** the NPM dependencies at the root of the workspace. This means that there isn't any *node_modules* directory nested inside the packages directories. The NPM dependencies are installed in a *node_modules* directory at the root of the workspace and a single *yarn.lock* file is generated at the root of the workspace.

Since the website is not handled by the monorepo tooling, the *website* directory will also contain a *node_modules* directory and a *yarn.lock* file.

**Website dependencies linking**

How come the website can use non-published packages of the monorepo?

To make this work, a [custom script](https://github.com/gsoft-inc/sg-brand/blob/master/website/scripts/setup-website-yarn-links.js) has been developed to automatically create symlinks between the website and the packages of the monorepo.

### Installation

This project use Yarn workspace. Therefore, you must install Yarn:

```
choco install yarn
``` 

For more options to install Yarn, view https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable.

To install the project, open a terminal at the root of the workspace and execute the following command:

```bash
yarn bootstrap
```

The installation should take up to 5 minutes.

By default, the packages and the website are installed.

To only install the packages, instead, use the following command:

```bash
yarn bootstrap:pkg
```

If you want to install the website later, use the default installation command or:

```bash
yarn bootstrap:website
```

### Develop a component

**Storybook**

Every components must be developed in [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org).

Storybook is a convenient sandbox that help the developpers write organized and isolated stories that match the specifications of the component. Storybook also facilitate functionnal testing and integrate very well with automated visual testing technologies.

The resulting Storybook *playbook* will represent a catalog of all the Sharegate design system components and will be available online for the design team.

For more informations about automated visual tests, view the [Testings](https://github.com/gsoft-inc/sg-brand/blob/master/README.md#testing) section.

**Start developing**

The tooling to develop a component involve 2 processes:

- A process that watch & re-compile the packages
- A process that run the Storybook app

Therefore, [open 2 terminals in VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal#_managing-multiple-terminals).

The first terminal will watch & compile the packages. Execute the following command at the root of the workspace:

```bash
yarn start
```

The second terminal will start the Storybook app. Executing the following command at the root of the workspace:

```bash
yarn start:sb
```

Any updates to the packages (components, SUI theme, tachyons, ...) or Storybook's stories will automatically re-compile the packages and refresh the Storybook app accordingly.

For more information about the development of a component view blabla..

### Update the website

The tooling to update the website involve 2 processes:

- A process that watch & re-compile the packages
- A process that run the website

Therefore, [open 2 terminals in VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal#_managing-multiple-terminals).

The first terminal will watch & compile the packages. Execute the following command at the root of the workspace:

```bash
yarn start
```

The second terminal will start the website. Execute the following command at the root of the workspace:

```bash
yarn start:website
```

Any updates to the packages (components, SUI theme, tachyons, ...) or the website's pages  will be automatically re-compile the packages and refresh the website accordingly.

For more information about the development of the website view blabla..

### Release the packages

Releasing the packages includes several steps:

1. Compile the packages code for production
2. Identifies packages that have been updated since the previous release (View the [Monorepo](https://github.com/gsoft-inc/sg-brand#monorepo) section.)
3. Bump the version of the identified packages
4. Modifies package metadata to reflect new release
5. Publish the packages to NPM
6. Push those changes to Git

Fortunatelly, this is all automated with a few commands!

Before you release, make sure you have **write access** to every selected NPM packages and that you are [logged in to NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/logging-in-to-an-npm-enterprise-registry-from-the-command-line).

To release, open a terminal at the root of the workspace and execute the following commands:

```bash
yarn new-version
yarn release:pkg
git push
```

#### Troubleshooting

**Github**

Make sure you're Git is clean (No pending changes).

**NPM**

Make sure you have **write access** to the selected NPM packages.

If you are using 2FA, make sure you specified a valid OTP.

**Compilation**

If the packages failed to compile, it's easier to debug without executing the full release flow everytime. To do so, instead, execute the following command:

```bash
yarn build:pkg
```

By default, packages compilation output will be in their respective *dist* directory. For more details, view the specific packages README file.

### Release Storybook

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/4b420380-aed1-4dc6-b002-6efe7b413025/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/sg-storybook/deploys)

Releasing Storybook includes a few steps:

1. Build storybook into a static web app
2. Deploy the static web app to Netlify

Before you release, make sure you have access to the GSoft Netlify team.

To release, open a terminal at the root of the workspace and execute the following command:

```bash
yarn release:sb
```

Open a web browser and navigate to https://sg-storybook.netlify.com.

#### Troubleshooting

**Netlify**

Login to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com) and make sure you have access to the GSoft team and the **sg-storybook** site.

Make sure the site `App ID` of **sg-storybook** site match the `--site` parameter of the script `sb:deploy` in the *packages/react-components/package.json* file.

To deploy Storybook without building the static web app everytime, navigate to the *packages/react-components* directory and execute the following command:

```bash
yarn sb:deploy
```

**Build the static web app**

If the packages failed to compile you can build the packages without executing the full release flow everytime. To do so, execute the following command:

```bash
yarn build:sb
```

The output will be available in the *packages/react-components/storybook/dist* directory. For more details, view the specific packages README file.

### Release the website

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/65b52a34-8224-4783-bed2-64ffd05d36af/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/sg-orbit/deploys)

Releasing the website includes a few steps:

1. Build docz into a static web app
2. Deploy the static web app to Netlify

Before you release, make sure you have access to the GSoft Netlify team and the **sg-orbit** site.

You can release the website on a staging or production environment.

#### Staging

To release on the staging environment, open a terminal at the root of the workspace and execute the following command:

```bash
yarn release:website
```

Open a web browser and navigate to https://5d1663eba8dbff36f23ecdf0--sg-orbit.netlify.com.

#### Production

To release on the production environment, open a terminal at the root of the workspace and execute the following command:

```bash
yarn release:website:prod
```

Open a web browser and navigate to https://sg-orbit.netlify.com.

#### Troubleshooting

**Netlify**

Login to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com) and make sure you have access to the GSoft team and to **sg-orbit** site.

Make sure the site `App ID` of **sg-orbit** site match the `--site` parameter of the scripts `deploy:staging` and `deploy:prod` in the *website/package.json* file.

To deploy the website without building the static web app everytime, navigate to the *website* directory and execute any of the following command:

```bash
yarn deploy:staging
yarn deploy:prod
```

**Build the static web app**

If the packages failed to compile you can build the packages without executing the full release flow everytime. To do so, execute the following command:

```bash
yarn build:website
```

The output will be available in the *website/.docz/dist* directory. For more details, view the specific packages README.

### Commands

Here's an exhaustive list of all the commands you might need to use. The following commands must be executed in a terminal opened at the root of the workspace.

**bootstrap**

Install the NPM dependencies for every packages of the monorepo and the website. Once the NPM dependencies are installed a custom **setup** step will be executed for every packages and the website.

Depending of the packages / website, the setup step will perform a number of required additional installation tasks.

As an example, the *semantic-ui-theme* package must be **build once** before it can be **watch**.

```bash
yarn bootstrap
```

**bootstrap:pkg**

Same as *bootstrap* but only for the packages.

```bash
yarn bootstrap:pkg
```

**bootstrap:website**

Same as *bootstrap* but only for the website.

```bash
yarn bootstrap:website
```

**start**

Compile & watch all the packages.

```bash
yarn start
```

**start:sb**

Start Storybook.

```bash
yarn start:sb
```

**start:website**

Start the website.

```bash
yarn start:website
```

**build**

Build all the packages, Storybook and the website for production.

```bash
yarn build
```

**build:pkg**

Same as *build* but only for the packages.

```bash
yarn build:pkg
```

**build:sb**

Same as *build* but only for Storybook.

```bash
yarn build:sb
```

**build:website**

Same as *build* but only for the website.

```bash
yarn build:website
```

**release:pkg**

View the section [Release the packages](https://github.com/gsoft-inc/sg-brand#release-the-packages).

**release:pkg:next**

Same as *release:pkg* but with the *next* [dist-tag](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/dist-tag).

**release:sb**

View the section [Release Storybook](https://github.com/gsoft-inc/sg-brand#release-storybook).

**release:website**
**release:website:prod**

View the section [Release the website](https://github.com/gsoft-inc/sg-brand#release-the-website).

**reset**

Reset the monorepo installation. The following will be deleted:

- All the *node_modules* directories
- All the *yarn.lock* files
- All the compiled & cache folders

If any of the *node_modules* directories failed to be deleted, close & re-open VSCode and try to manually delete them.

```bash
yarn reset
```

**update**

Use this command when you update a dependency and you want it installed without executing the setup steps.

Use this command if you add a new package to the monorepo and you need to update the packages inter-dependencies.

```bash
yarn update
```

**lint**

Execute all the linters against the packages and the website.

```bash
yarn lint
```

**chromatic**

Launch the automated visual tests on Chromatic QA. For more information on the automated visual tests, view the [Testing](https://github.com/gsoft-inc/sg-brand#testing) section.

```bash
yarn chromatic
```

### Testing

For testing the components we currently rely only on automated visual testing.

*Visual testing* has been preferred to *structural* or *interactions* testings since this approach assert on what visually appears on the screen instead of asserting on specifics CSS selectors or DOM elements. 

This is a more *black box* and *robust* testing approach since it shouldn't requires to modify the tests if the code refactor haven't change anything visually.

Visual testing can also easily perform cross-browsers testing.

Setting all the tools to perform automated visual tests involve a lot of time and knowledge. Therefore, we bought a license of [Chromatic QA](https://www.chromaticqa.com). This is the perfect tool for us since it perfectly integrate with Storybook. 

To understand how to write Storybook stories for Chromatic QA, view the [react-components documentation](https://github.com/gsoft-inc/sg-brand/blob/master/packages/react-components/README.md).

For access to our Chromatic QA environment, ask to join the [gsoft-inc](https://github.com/gsoft-inc) on Github.

For more information about automated visual testing:

- https://storybook.js.org/docs/testing/automated-visual-testing
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE-xQxN9Sps

### CI

[Circle CI](https://circleci.com) is the continuous integration platform for this repository. To have access to the CI environment, ask to join the [gsoft-inc](https://github.com/gsoft-inc) on Github.

2 builds are currently configured:

**On commits**

On every commits the CI will execute the linters.

**Nightly**

Once per night, the CI will execute the automated visual tests. Those tests can't be executed on every commits since visual test snapshots are pricy and limited.

For more information on the automated visual tests, view the [Testing](https://github.com/gsoft-inc/sg-brand#testing) section.

#### Troubleshooting

**SSH**

To investigate general problems with Circle CI you can [debug with SSH](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/ssh-access-jobs).

**Chromatic & Storybook**

If Chromatic can't reach the Storybook server, the Storybook potentially can't compile.

Sadly the Chromatic CLI doesn't properly relay Storybook compilation errors. To see the errors, build the Storybook app locally.

### Add a new packages to the monorepo

There is a few steps to add a new packages to the monorepo.

Before you add a new package, please read the [GSoft Github guidelines](https://github.com/gsoft-inc/github-guidelines#npm-package-name).

When ready, proceed to the next step.

#### Create the package

First, create a new folder matching the package name in the *packages* directory.

Open a terminal, navigate to the newly created directory and execute the following command:

```bash
yarn init
```

Answer the questions.

Once the *package.json* is generated, please read again [GSoft Github guidelines](https://github.com/gsoft-inc/github-guidelines#npm-package-name) and make sure the package name, author and license are valid.

Dont forget to add the scope *@sharegate* before the package name. For example if the project name is "foo", your package name should be "@sharegate/foo".

Make sure the package publish access is *public* by adding the following to the *package.json* file:

```javascript
"publishConfig": {
    "access": "public"
}
```

#### Dependencies

#### Website links

Your packages 

Add your new project has "peerDependency", "devDependency" or "dependency" of any project who need it.

If the "website" project use your new project, make sure you add it to /website/scripts/setup-website-yarn-links.js.

### Add a new NPM package dev dependency

C'EST FAUX

Dont add new packages to the root of the workspace unless you know what you are doing.

Instead add new packages to sub packages of the workspace.

To do so, in your terminal, navigate to the directory of the package and the use yarn to add the package:

`yarn add PACKAGE_NAME [--dev]` will install the package.

### Add a yarn scripts

Think of scripts as atomic script. It means that a script should only do one thing, then you can have other scripts than compose those scripts.

Example:

Instead of doing

```
"scripts": {
    "build": rimraf dist && babel src -d dist 
}
```

Do

```
"scripts": {
    "build": "yarn delete && yarn transpile",
    "delete": "rimraf dist",
    "transpile": "babel src -d dist"
}
```

Every scripts should be executable from the root of the workspace. Make sure you add a script entry in the package.json located at the root event if your script is already define in a sub-project.

Every "Lerna" related scripts should be added in the the root package.json since Lerna is installed at the root of the workspace.

For example, take the react-components project, since we execute a babel compilation for all the individual components, we must define a `lerna exec` command, to call the babel CLI, therefore, we added this script in the root package.json

You can have scripts in sub project. Again, take the react-components project. A script is define in the actual project to start storybook since the workspace doesn't know about storybook, this is a dependency of react-components not of the whole workspace. Therefore, the scripts is define in the react-components project and a script entry has been added to the root package.json to call the script in the sub project.

To run multiple commands simultaneously, use `run-p`, to run multiple commands sequentially, use `run-s`, otherwise use `yarn`

## Good to remember

Bootstrap specify "--ignore-scripts" to yarn install because otherwise semantic-ui will try to reinstall everytime we do a yarn install. Haven't found any other way to prevent it.

Chromaticqa is inconsistant if we load a custom font

# TODO

- Doc une page packages Ã  la Babel: https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/packages/README.md

- Hot reload doesn't seem to work anymore with storybook? Maybe it's the update to the babel config of the components? Maybe the update to storybook?

- Deprecate old packages (semantic-ui-sg, tachyons-sg, sg-brand-foundation)

- Inclure la "files" property dans les package.json

- Hookify components

- Some sort of intellisense? Like typescript types?

- Prendre la derniÃ¨re version de Apricot pour remote-search-input (https://dev.azure.com/sharegate/Sharegate.Gravt/_git/Sharegate.Gravt/pullrequest/3118)

- Delete custom script sto copy LICENSE when released: https://github.com/lerna/lerna/commit/d410a58e3039ea7db0ad6f6d50f33b2024cda709

- Babel - compile for production
