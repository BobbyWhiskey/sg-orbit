/* main.css */
/* ... */

@import "~@sharegate/semantic-ui-theme/button.css";

```css
/* main.css */

### How to work with Semantic UI 

Prior to make any changes, please make sure you read the [Semantic UI documentation](https://semantic-ui.com/) and understand how [theming works](https://semantic-ui.com/usage/theming.html).

Semantic UI offer 3 layers of theming:
- Defaults Theme
- Packaged Theme
- Site Theme

Customization of Semantic UI should only happens at the **Packaged Theme** layer to ensure we can still benefits from updates.

Our implementation of the `Sharegate Style Guildelines` is located in the packaged theme `sharegate`. You can find it at `semantic/src/themes/sharegate`.

_Currently, you shouldn't need to create additional packaged theme._

In the `sharegate` theme folder, You will find 2 types of files: `.overrides` and `.variables`.

The `.variables` files are used to override the value of existing variables or introduce new variables.

The `.overrides` files provide the ability to override existing Semantic UI CSS selectors. **Before you override a selector, make sure this is your last resort**.

Before you override a selector, you should answer **no** to all the following questions:
- Can I use an existing Semantic UI variable to make my modification?
- Does my modification fix a use case specific to my current project? 
- Does my modification belong in the source code of my Sharegate project?

Finally ...

You should never do the followings:
- Update code in `semantic/src/definitions`
- Update code in `semantic/tasks`
- Update Semantic UI `default` theme in `semantic/src/themes/default`
- Use the `Site Theme` layer
