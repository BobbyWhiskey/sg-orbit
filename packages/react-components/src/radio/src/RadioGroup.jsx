// TODO:
//   - should define a name for the group to pass to all the radio button.
//   - should provide props like isReadOnly to all the radio button.
//   - should accept size and pass it to all the radio button.
//   - should accept reverse and pass it to all the radio button.
//   - should accept a value and defaultValue
//   - should accept an onChange callback
//   - should it handle an autofocus prop and focus the first children? In this case radio button should support directly autofocus.


// Consider providing everything through a context since most of there props doesn't make since on a standalone radio button.


// Direction, row or column, column by default. Good timing to implement the Flex component.
