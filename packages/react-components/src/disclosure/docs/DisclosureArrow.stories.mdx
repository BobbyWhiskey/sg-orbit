## Usage

Otherwise, a disclosure arrow can also be controlled by the `open` prop.

### Disclosure context

When a disclosure arrow is nested in a component implementing a `DisclosureContext`, the arrow will automatically change direction when `isOpen` state change.

                <Text>EVE Online</Text>
                <DisclosureArrow slot="right-icon" />
            </Button>
