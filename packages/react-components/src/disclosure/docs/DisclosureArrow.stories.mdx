# DisclosureArrow

A top / bottom pointing arrow to hint that activating the trigger will display additional content.

## Usage

When a disclosure arrow is nested in a component implementing a `DisclosureContext`, the arrow will automatically change direction when the `isOpen` prop change. Otherwise, a disclosure arrow can be controlled with the `open` prop.
