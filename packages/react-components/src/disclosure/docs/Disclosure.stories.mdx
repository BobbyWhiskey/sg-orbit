# Disclosure

<Tagline>The disclosure component is used to create regions of content that can expand/collapse with a simple animation.</Tagline>

<ComponentInfo
    usage={"import { Disclosure, Content } from \"@orbit-ui/react-components\""}
    ariaPath="#disclosure"
    githubPath="/packages/react-components/src/disclosure/src"
/>

## Accessibility

The disclosure's trigger that shows and hides the content must be a [button element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button) or have the [role button](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/button_role).

## Usage

### Default

A default disclosure using a button.

<Preview>
    <Story name="default">
        <Disclosure>
            <Button>EVE Online</Button>
            <Content>Eve Online is a space-based, persistent world massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) developed and published by CCP Games. Players of Eve Online can participate in a number of in-game professions and activities, including mining, piracy, manufacturing, trading, exploration, and combat (both player versus environment and player versus player). The game contains a total of 7,800 star systems that can be visited by players.</Content>
        </Disclosure>
    </Story>
</Preview>

### Render props

A disclosure component can update is content based on the `isOpen` value by providing a render prop function.

<Preview>
    <Story name="render props">
        <Disclosure>
            {({ isOpen }) => (
                <>
                    <Button color={isOpen ? "primary" : "secondary"}>
                        EVE Online
                    </Button>
                    <Content>Eve Online is a space-based, persistent world massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) developed and published by CCP Games. Players of Eve Online can participate in a number of in-game professions and activities, including mining, piracy, manufacturing, trading, exploration, and combat (both player versus environment and player versus player). The game contains a total of 7,800 star systems that can be visited by players.</Content>
                </>
            )}
        </Disclosure>
    </Story>
</Preview>

### Custom trigger

The previous [render props](#render-props) example could also be achieve by using a custom component. It's possible by using the `useDisclosureContext`.

<Preview filePath="/disclosure/docs/CustomDisclosureTrigger" noInline />

## Disclosure arrow

For some cases you can use a [disclosure arrow](?path=/docs/disclosure-arrow--context) component to hint that activating the button will display additional content.

<Preview>
    <Story name="disclosure arrow">
        <Disclosure>
            <Button>
                <Text>EVE Online</Text>
                <DisclosureArrow slot="right-icon" />
            </Button>
            <Content>Eve Online is a space-based, persistent world massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) developed and published by CCP Games. Players of Eve Online can participate in a number of in-game professions and activities, including mining, piracy, manufacturing, trading, exploration, and combat (both player versus environment and player versus player). The game contains a total of 7,800 star systems that can be visited by players.</Content>
        </Disclosure>
    </Story>
</Preview>

### Controlled

A disclosure component can handle `open` state in controlled mode.
