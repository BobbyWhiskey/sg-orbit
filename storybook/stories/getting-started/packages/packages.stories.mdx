# Packages

Multiple packages compose Orbit UI. Based on which type of application you're building you'll choose a different composition. For more information view the [installation page](?path=/docs/getting-started-installation--page).

## Bundles

Bundles are the easiest way to install Orbit UI in your app with a single package.

    packages={[
        { name: "@orbit-ui/react", description: "A single package bundle to use Orbit UI in a React app.", relativePath: "packages/bundles/react" }

## Core

The core packages are the backbone of Orbit UI. They include all the Orbit UI bits that are related to styling.

<PackagesTable
    packages={[
        { name: "@orbit-ui/css-normalize", description: "Orbit UI custom CSS normalizer for Edge, Chrome, Firefox and Safari.", relativePath: "packages/css-normalize" },
        { name: "@orbit-ui/fonts", description: "The fonts of Orbit UI.", relativePath: "packages/fonts" },
        { name: "@orbit-ui/icons", description: "The icons of Orbit UI.", relativePath: "packages/icons" },
        { name: "@orbit-ui/foundation", description: "A set of CSS variables for Orbit UI colors, spacing and typography.", relativePath: "packages/foundation" },
        { name: "@orbit-ui/tachyons", description: <Fragment>A custom version of the <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons">Tachyons library</ExternalLink>.</Fragment>, relativePath: "packages/tachyons" }
    ]}
/>

## React components

Orbit UI components are built on top of [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/) and [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/). When Orbit UI doesn't provide a component, you should use a component from Semantic UI React.

<PackagesTable
    packages={[
        { name: "@orbit-ui/react-components", description: "Orbit UI React components.", relativePath: "packages/react-components" },
        { name: "@orbit-ui/semantic-ui-theme", description: <Fragment>Custom <ExternalLink href="https://semantic-ui.com">Semantic UI</ExternalLink> theme for Orbit UI. The theme is based on the variables of @orbit-ui/foundation.</Fragment>, relativePath: "packages/semantic-ui-theme" }
    ]}
