# Typography

Typography is all about adjusting the text within the design while creating powerful content. It provides attractive appearance and preserves the aesthetic value of your content. It plays a vital role in setting the overall tone of your website, and ensures a great user experience.

Our typography is inspired by one of our design principles _"Be simple"_. By that we tend to be meaningful and straight forward in our designs, on top of always making things easy to use for our customers.

Not only did we need a font that would match that, but that would allow us to integrate it as well in our products as in our marketing and brand assets. It is important that our font reflects our personality: _fun_, _human_ and _helpful_. With its linear, geometric forms, its simplicity and clarity, and with its fun and perfect curves, [Calibre](https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/calibre/) is the perfect choice for us.

Our typography utilities includes [type scale](http://tachyons.io/docs/typography/scale/), [measure](http://tachyons.io/docs/typography/measure/), [line-height](http://tachyons.io/docs/typography/line-height/), [tracking](http://tachyons.io/docs/typography/tracking/), [font-weight](http://tachyons.io/docs/typography/font-weight/), [font-style](http://tachyons.io/docs/typography/font-style/), [vertical-align](http://tachyons.io/docs/typography/vertical-align/), [text-align](http://tachyons.io/docs/typography/text-align/), [text-transform](http://tachyons.io/docs/typography/text-transform/), [text-decoration](http://tachyons.io/docs/typography/text-decoration/) and [white-space](http://tachyons.io/docs/typography/white-space/).

You will find most of the documentation for typography utilities on [Tachyons website](http://tachyons.io/docs/). Keep in mind though that some sections have been adapted to Orbit foundation. For an exhaustive list of utilities classes for typography **including** our customizations, please refer to the [Tachyons section](#tachyons) below.

## Usage

In order to keep consistency and [vertical-rhythm](https://8thlight.com/blog/chris-peak/2012/12/30/vertical-rhythm.html) both titles and body copy should adopt a rational combination of *font-size*, *line-height* and *font-weight*. Enforcing strict heights to everything makes it easy to align two adjacent elements. Think of vertical rythmh as lines in your lined paper at school.

### Headlines

Headlines are the largest text on the screen, reserved for short, important text or numerals. When you add an headline to a page, **you must use the following combination of *font-size*, *line-height* and *font-weight***.

<Table
    columns={[
        { title: "Font Size", className: styles.class },
        { title: "Line Height", className: styles.lineHeight },
        { title: "Font Weight" },
        { title: "", className: styles.example }
    ]}
    rows={[
        ["f1", "lh1", "500", <h1 className="f1 fw5 lh1 flex items-center">Migrate, adapt, and control the cloud.</h1>],
        ["f2", "lh1", "500", <h1 className="f2 fw5 lh1 flex items-center">Migrate, adapt, and control the cloud.</h1>],
        ["f3", "lh3", "500", <h1 className="f3 fw5 lh3 flex items-center">Migrate, adapt, and <br/> control the cloud.</h1>],
        ["f4", "lh4", "500", <h1 className="f4 fw5 lh4 flex items-center">Migrate, adapt, and <br/>control the cloud.</h1>],
        ["f5", "lh2", "500", <h1 className="f5 fw5 lh2 flex items-center">Migrate, adapt, and <br/>control the cloud.</h1>]
    ]}
    rowClassName="h13"
/>

### Body

Body text is typically used for long-form writing as it works well for small text sizes. When you add body text to a page, **you must use the following combination of *font-size*, *line-height* and *font-weight***.

<Table
    columns={[
        { title: "Font Size", className: styles.class },
        { title: "Line Height", className: styles.lineHeight },
        { title: "Font Weight" },
        { title: "", className: styles.example }
    ]}
    rows={[
        ["f4", "lh4", "fw4", <p className="f4 lh4 flex items-center">If two pieces of the same type of metal touch in space they will permanently bond.</p>],
        ["f5", "lh2", "fw4", <p className="f5 lh2 flex items-center">If two pieces of the same type of metal touch in space they will permanently bond.</p>],
        ["f6", "lh4", "fw4", <p className="f6 lh4 flex items-center">If two pieces of the same type of metal touch in space they will permanently bond.</p>],
        ["f7", "lh3", "fw4", <p className="f7 lh3 flex items-center">If two pieces of the same type of metal touch in space they will permanently bond.</p>],
        ["f8", "lh5", "fw4", <p className="f8 lh5 flex items-center">If two pieces of the same type of metal touch in space<br/> they will permanently bond.</p>],
        ["f9", "lh1", "fw4", <p className="f9 lh1 flex items-center">If two pieces of the same type of metal touch in space<br/> they will permanently bond.</p>]
    ]}
    rowClassName="h13"
/>

## Utilities

### Type scale

A simple ratio-based scale with 9 options. Font sizes are designed to work in combination with line-height values so as to result in more sensible numbers wherever possible.

<Table
    columns={[
        { title: "Class", className: styles.class },
        { title: "Value", className: styles.value },
        { title: "Variable" },
        { title: "", className: styles.example }
    ]}
    rows={[
        ["f1", "3rem (48px)", "--type-scale-1", <p className="f1">A modular scale</p>],
        ["f2", "2.5rem (40px)", "--type-scale-2", <p className="f2">A modular scale</p>],
        ["f3", "2rem (32px) ", "--type-scale-3", <p className="f3">A modular scale</p>],
        ["f4", "1.5rem (24px)", "--type-scale-4", <p className="f4">A modular scale</p>],
        ["f5", "1.25rem (20px)", "--type-scale-5", <p className="f5">A modular scale</p>],
        ["f6", "1.125rem (18px)", "--type-scale-6", <p className="f6">A modular scale</p>],
        ["f7", "1rem (16px)", "--type-scale-7", <p className="f7">A modular scale</p>],
        ["f8", "0.875rem (14px)", "--type-scale-8", <p className="f8">A modular scale</p>],
        ["f9", "0.75rem (12px)", "--type-scale-9", <p className="f9">A modular scale</p>]
    ]}
    rowClassName="h13"
/>

### Line Height

Also known as leading, line height controls the amount of space between baselines in a block of text. A text's line height is proportional to its type size.

<Table
    columns={[
        { title: "Class", className: styles.class },
        { title: "Value" },
        { title: "", className: styles.example }
    ]}
    rows={[
        ["lh1", "1", <p className="lh1">If two pieces of the same type of metal touch in space they will permanently bond.</p>],
        ["lh2", "1.2", <p className="lh2">If two pieces of the same type of metal touch in space they will permanently bond.</p>],
        ["lh3", "1.25", <p className="lh3">If two pieces of the same type of metal touch in space they will permanently bond.</p>],
        ["lh4", "1.33333", <p className="lh4">If two pieces of the same type of metal touch in space they will permanently bond.</p>],
        ["lh5", "1.4285714286", <p className="lh5">If two pieces of the same type of metal touch in space they will permanently bond.</p>],
        ["lh6", "15", <p className="lh6">If two pieces of the same type of metal touch in space they will permanently bond.</p>]
    ]}
    rowClassName="h13"
/>

### Font Weight

Weight refers to the relative thickness of a font's stroke. A typeface can come in many weights; and four to six weights is a typical number available for a typeface. Varying the font-weight of different pieces of text can help create contrast between pieces of information.

<Table
    columns={[
        { title: "Class", className: styles.class },
        { title: "Value" },
        { title: "", className: styles.example }
    ]}
    rows={[
        ["fw1", "100", <p className="fw1">Space Flight Program</p>],
        ["fw3", "300", <p className="fw3">Space Flight Program</p>],
        ["fw4", "400", <p className="fw4">Space Flight Program</p>],
        ["fw5", "500", <p className="fw5">Space Flight Program</p>],
        ["fw6", "600", <p className="fw6">Space Flight Program</p>],
        ["fw7", "700", <p className="fw7">Space Flight Program</p>],
        ["fw9", "900", <p className="fw9">Space Flight Program</p>]
    ]}
    rowClassName="h13"
/>
