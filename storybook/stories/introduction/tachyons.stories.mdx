# Tachyons

[Tachyons](https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons) is a widely adopted [Atomic CSS library](https://acss.io/) ([also called Functional CSS](https://css-tricks.com/lets-define-exactly-atomic-css/)) that aims to break down CSS rules into small, reusable and single-purpose classes.
These classes helps write _composable_, _readable_ and _consistant_ CSS code.

_Composability_ and _reusability_ eliminates the need to adopt a methodology like [BEM](http://getbem.com/) to mitigate the effect of CSS global-mutable-stateful classes. Methodologies like BEM are
complex and hard to grasp for most full stack developers and should be avoid. Composable and reusable CSS classes eliminate the need to write most of the features related custom CSS classes (which is pretty cool since you don't need to name classes anymore!)
and therefore the need to adopt a methodology.

One could argue that [CSS modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) also solve CSS global-mutable-stateful classes problems, which is true, but at the expense of reusability.

_Readability_ leads to _maintability_. If the code is easy to read and understand, the code is easy to maintain. Once you get used to Tachyons naming scheme you can understand the style immediatly. No more indirection!

_Consistency_ makes designers happy!

## Customization

Orbit provide a custom version of the Tachyons library based on [Orbit foundation](?path=/docs/introduction-foundation--page) variables. You will find most of the documentation on [Tachyons website](http://tachyons.io/docs). For Orbit customization documentation, please refer to the list of customization below and the _Materials_ pages.

### Spacing scale

Orbit foundation [spacing scale](?path=/docs/materials-layout-spacing--page) have been implemented as Tachyons CSS classes. Tachyons spacing scale have been increased from _7_ to _13_ values.

This means that all the paddings and margins variants are available from `0 to 13`. Please refer to the [spacing page](?path=/docs/materials-layout-spacing--page) for an exhaustive list of all the available classes.

### Typography

Tachyons have been adapted to Orbit foundation [typography](?path=/docs/materials-typography--page).

- [Type scale](?path=/docs/materials-typography--page#font-size) have been increased from _7_ to _9_ values. Classes are available from `f1` to `f9`.

- [Line height](?path=/docs/materials-typography--page#line-height) have been increased to _6_ values. Classes are available from `lh1` to `lh6`. Tachyons original line-height classes `lh-solid`, `lh-title` and `lh-copy` should not be used.

### Skins

Tachyons original colors have been replaced with Orbit foundation colors.

For any [UI](?path=/docs/materials-colours-ui--page) or [ShareGate](?path=/docs/materials-colours-sharegate--page) colors, the following classes are available:

- [_color-name_]-[_50-900_] (ex. `sunray-50`)

- hover-[_color-name_]-[_50-900_] (ex. `hover-sunray-50`)

- bg-[_color-name_]-[_50-900_] (ex. `bg-sunray-50`)

- hover-bg-[_color-name_]-[_50-900_] (ex. `hover-bg-sunray-50`)

- b--[_color-name_]-[_50-900_] (ex. `b--sunary-50`)

- hover-b--[_color-name_]-[_50-900_] (ex. `hover-b--sunary-50`)

- fill-[_color-name_]-[_50-900_] (ex. `fill-sunray-50`)

- hover-fill-[_color-name_]-[_50-900_] (ex. `hover-fill-sunray-50`)

### Brands

The colors of the Sharegate [brands](?path=/docs/materials-colours-brands--page) have been added to Tachyons.

The brands colors classes support the same naming scheme as the other [colors](#skins) classes but use a [_brand-name_] instead of a [_color-name_]. For any [brands](?path=/docs/materials-colours-brands--page), the following classes are available:

- [_brand-name_]-[_50-900_] (ex. `apricot-50`)

Additional _primary_ classes are also available:

- primary-[_50-900_] (ex. `primary-50`).

## Installation

Please refer to the [installation page](?path=/docs/introduction-installation--page) for instructions.

## Quick start

Once installed, start composing your style with Tachyons reusable CSS classes:

```jsx dark
<p>Let's use <span className="f2 sunray-400">Tachyons!</span></p>
```

To align a list of items horizontally:

```jsx dark
<div className="flex">
    <div>To</div>
    <div>the</div>
    <div>moon!</div>
</div>
```

To render a 24px / 24px icon filled with _apricot_ brand color:

```jsx dark
<GearIcon className="w6 h6 fill-apricot-500" />
```

To align a text with an icon:

```jsx dark
<span className="flex items-center">
    Check
    <CheckIcon24 className="w6 h6 ml1 fill-success-500" />
</span>
```

To specify paddings for each side of an element:

```jsx dark
<div className="pa2">Im padded!</div>
```

To specify a margin-right between each elements:

```jsx dark
<div className="flex">
    <div className="mr2">To</div>
    <div className="mr2">the</div>
    <div>moon!</div>
</div>
```

To specify the background and text color of an element:

```jsx dark
<div className="bg-sunray-400 white">The Sun also emits X-rays</div>
```

By combining Tachyons with a library like [classnames](https://github.com/JedWatson/classnames) you can easily had dynamic styles to an element based on one or more conditions:

```jsx dark
import cx from "classnames";

function Button({ text, disabled }) {
    return (
        <div className={cx({ "bg-cloud-100": disabled, "bg-primary-500": !disabled })}>
            {text}
        </div>
    );
}

```

## Override default variables

You can override the default variables used by Tachyons, by overriding the [foundation](?path=/docs/introduction-foundation--page#override-default-variables) variables.

## Legacy version

If you support an old browser that doesn't support CSS variables and you dont have a build process to transpile the CSS variables, import the legacy version of Tachyons:

```css dark
@import "~@orbit-ui/tachyons/legacy.css";
@import "~@orbit-ui/tachyons/legacy.min.css";
```
