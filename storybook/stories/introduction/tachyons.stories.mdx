# Tachyons

[Tachyons](https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons) is a widely adopted [Atomic CSS library](https://acss.io/) ([also called Functional CSS](https://css-tricks.com/lets-define-exactly-atomic-css/)) that aims to break down CSS rules into small, reusable and single-purpose classes.
These classes helps write _composable_, _readable_ and _consistant_ CSS code.

_Composability_ and _reusability_ eliminates the need to adopt a methodology like [BEM](http://getbem.com/) to mitigate the effect of CSS global-mutable-stateful classes. Methodologies like BEM are
complex and hard to grasp for most full stack developers and should be avoid. Composable and reusable CSS classes eliminate the need to write most of the features related custom CSS classes (which is pretty cool since you don't need to name classes anymore!)
and therefore the need to adopt a methodology.

One could argue that [CSS modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) also solve CSS global-mutable-stateful classes problems, which is true, but at the expense of reusability.

_Readability_ leads to _maintability_. If the code is easy to read and understand, the code is easy to maintain. Once you get used to Tachyons naming scheme you can understand the style immediatly. No more indirection!

_Consistency_ makes designers happy!

## Customization

Orbit provide a custom version of the Tachyons library based on [Orbit foundation](?path=/docs/introduction-foundation--page) variables. These customizations includes:

- a custom [spacing scale](https://tachyons.io/docs/layout/spacing/)

- a custom [type scale](https://tachyons.io/docs/typography/scale/)

- a custom [skin](https://tachyons.io/docs/themes/skins/) (colors)

- first class support for Sharegate brand & products

Most of the documentation is available on [Tachyons website](http://tachyons.io/docs). For Orbit customization documentation, refer to the [usage section](#usage).

## Installation

Please refer to the [installation page](?path=/docs/introduction-installation--page) for instructions.

## Usage

### Quick start

Once you installed Tachyons you can start composing your style with Tachyons reusable CSS classes.

Here's an example to create an horizontal list of styled `div`.

<Preview>
    <div className="flex flex-row">
        <div className="bg-sunray-400 white pa2 mr2">1</div>
        <div className="bg-sunray-400 white pa2 mr2">2</div>
        <div className="bg-sunray-400 white pa2">3</div>
    </div>
</Preview>

### Custom spacing scale

Orbit foundation [spacing scale](?path=/docs/materials-layout-spacing--page) have been implemented as Tachyons CSS classes.

All paddings and margins variants are available from `0 to 13` (ex. `pa0` ... `pa13`, `ma0` ... `ma13`, ...).

Please refer to [Tachyons official spacing documentation](https://tachyons.io/docs/layout/spacing/) for an exhaustive list of all the variants.

<Preview>
    <div className="flex flex-row items-end">
        <div className="pa2 mr2 bg-sunray-400 white">1</div>
        <div className="pr5 pl5 pb5 pt5 mr2 bg-sunray-400 white">2</div>
        <div className="pr8 pl8 pb8 pt8 bg-sunray-400 white">3</div>
    </div>
</Preview>

### Custom type scale

Orbit foundation [type scale](?path=/docs/materials-typography--page) is also available through Tachyons CSS classes.

- [Font size](?path=/docs/materials-typography--page#font-size) classes are available from `f1` to `f9`.

- [Line height](?path=/docs/materials-typography--page#line-height) classes are available from `lh1` to `lh6`.

- [Font weight](?path=/docs/materials-typography--page#font-weight) classes are available from `fw1` to `fw9`.

<Preview>
    <div className="flex flex-row items-end">
        <div className="f9 fw1 pa2 mr2 bg-sunray-400 white">1</div>
        <div className="f4 fw4 pa2 mr2 bg-sunray-400 white">2</div>
        <div className="f1 fw9 pa2 bg-sunray-400 white">3</div>
    </div>
</Preview>

### Colors

Tachyons original colors have been overrided with Orbit foundation [UI](?path=/docs/materials-colours-ui--page) and [ShareGate](?path=/docs/materials-colours-sharegate--page) colors.

The following classes are available:

- [color-name]-[50-900] (ex. `sunray-50`, `sunray-900`)

- bg-[color-name]-[50-900] (ex. `bg-sunray-50`, `bg-sunray-900`)

- b--[color-name]-[50-900] (ex. `b--sunary-50`, `b--sunray-900`)

- fill-[color-name]-[50-900] (ex. `fill-sunray-50`, `fill-sunray-900`)

<Preview>
    <div className="flex flex-row items-end">
        <div className="bg-sunray-400 white b--sunray-400 ba pa2 mr2">1</div>
        <div className="bg-white sunray-400 b--sunray-400 ba pa2 mr2">2</div>
    </div>
</Preview>

### Brands

ShareGate [brands colors](?path=/docs/materials-colours-brands--page) have been added to Tachyons.

The brands colors classes support the same naming scheme as [colors](#colors) classes but instead of a "color-name" you must specify a "brand-name". An additional `primary` color is also available:

- [brand-name]-[50-900] (ex. `apricot-50`, `primary-900`)

- primary-[50-900] (ex. `apricot-50`, `primary-900`)

<Preview>
    <div className="flex flex-row items-end">
        <div className="bg-apricot-400 white b--apricot-400 ba pa2 mr2">1</div>
        <div className="bg-overcast-400 white b--overcast-400 ba pa2 mr2">2</div>
        <div className="bg-desktop-400 white b--desktop-400 ba pa2 mr2">3</div>
        <div className="bg-white primary-400 b--primary-400 ba pa2">4</div>
    </div>
</Preview>

## Override default variables

You can override the default variables used by Tachyons, by overriding the [foundation](?path=/docs/introduction-foundation--page#override-default-variables) variables.

## Legacy version

If you support an old browser that doesn't support CSS variables and you dont have a build process to transpile the CSS variables, import the legacy version of Tachyons:

```css
@import "~@orbit-ui/tachyons/legacy.css";
@import "~@orbit-ui/tachyons/legacy.min.css";
```
